The comparison of Bing vs. Google based on the provided results indicates a low overlap between their search outputs, with an overlap percentage mostly ranging between 0% and 30%. The Spearman coefficient values vary, suggesting inconsistent ranking correlations. Overall, the findings highlight notable differences in how both search engines retrieve and rank information.
